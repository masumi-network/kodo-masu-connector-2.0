## What Gets Deployed Automatically

### With `startup.sh` (Basic):
- ✅ All robustness improvements (rate limiting, caching, circuit breakers)
- ✅ 16 workers per API instance
- ✅ Database optimizations
- ✅ Payment completion fixes
- ✅ All core services
- ❌ Horizontal scaling
- ❌ Load balancer
- ❌ Monitoring dashboard

### With `deploy-scaled.sh` (Full):
- ✅ Everything from basic deployment
- ✅ 3 API instances (48 total workers)
- ✅ Nginx load balancer
- ✅ Metrics endpoint
- ✅ High availability setup
- ✅ Enhanced caching at LB level

## Quick Decision Guide

Use **Basic Deployment** (`startup.sh`) if:
- You're in development/testing
- You have < 100 concurrent users
- You want simple single-server setup
- You don't need high availability

Use **Scaled Deployment** (`deploy-scaled.sh`) if:
- You're in production
- You have > 100 concurrent users
- You need high availability
- You want load distribution
- You need monitoring capabilities

## Migration Path

To upgrade from basic to scaled deployment:
```bash
# Stop basic deployment
docker compose down

# Switch to scaled deployment
bash deploy-scaled.sh
```
